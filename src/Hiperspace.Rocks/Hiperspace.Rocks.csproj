      # Overview
      This release Significantly extends the functionality provided for Cube Analytics by hiperspace and combines streaming recalculation with graph navigation.  The  cube enhancement is detailed on [OLAP](https://www.cepheis.com/hiperspace/use-case-cube) use-case.  To support Cube analytics and code-generation for aggregation service, and  a number of additions were made to [Hipersapce](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hiperspace) and [HiLang](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HiLang) compiler.

      ## Blazor enhancements
      This release removes obsolete functions that are no longer used, such as `Space()` which has been replaced by `ExportAsync()` to provide a streaming transfer of updates from a `SessionSpace` for higher performance.

      ### SetSpace
      The Bind function now has an addition parameter for read/write so that filter can be used to *delete* elements without the need to open an additional connection

      ### SubSpace
      In addition to ExportAsync and ImportAsync, SubSpaces now include `ExportCacheAsync` and `ImportCacheAsync` to allow a server gRPC endpoint to select all the elements that are needed for a use-case and send them all in one message to the client.

      ### BrowserSpace
      This new type of space has been created in order to address the limitations of blazer web assembly that does not support synchronous network IO. BrowserSpace will be deprecated once WebAssembly support asynchronous threads.

      Browser space, any synchronous operation, uses only the local changes cache, while asynchronous operations use either the local cache or the remote store

      A matching change has been made to the HiLang code generator to use the local BrowserSpace for synchronous operations while

      ## Cube Changes

      * **CubeFact** property on an Element, now has a mathcing `ICubeFact` inteface and `ICubeDrillDown` for drill-down to further levels of detail
      * **CubeHierarchy** property identifies a **CubeDimension** that is a hierarchy, with a reference to the member key/value that provides the parent.  This results in as `ICubeHierarchy&lt;&gt;` interface added to the dimension element
      * **DeltaIndex** property now results in a `IDeltaIndex&lt;&gt;` element added to `RefSet&lt;&gt;` for the elements `SubSpace` collection, to retrieve all values that have changed since the timestamp.  This interface is used by the `Hiperspaced.Meta.Route` map to retrieve all elements that have changed since the last calculation
      *  **ElementVersion&lt;&gt;** now allows the `AsAt` property to be changed by an application to allow the historical data loading of a Hiperspace for Cube Analytics
      * **Additional functions** added for `drilldown()` (*from cube to details*) `cubename()` (*for Graph name of a cube observation*) `contextlabel()` (*use context when retrieving cubes* there might be separate summaries for P&amp;L and implied P&amp;L )
      * **SetSpace&lt;&gt;** now has an additional event `OnMissing` that allows missing cube aggregates to be calculated on-demand, or fetched from an external database
