# Overview
This release focuses on foundations to support of the migration of data from the current model of using key prefix for exceptions ("00" MetaModel, "0.." versioned, "00.." vector, "000.." sequence), to using the first-byte as a prefix for key-type.  To address this need, **dump / load** functions have been added to `SubSpace` for JSON data interchange"

## SubSpace
The JSON format is structured as `{ Key : Element { ....}, AsAt : timestamp, Value : Element { ....}}}`
*  IEnumerable<string> Dump() : *dump the content of the hiperspace to JSON*
*  Load(IEnumerable<string> source) : *load the JSON to Hiperspace*
