# Overview
This release is focused on improvements to the Cube functionality to provide a foundation for viewing Cube's through Hiperspace.DB's Blazor.   The Blazor explorer uses 
* Cube Dimension Name to display the next of the element in a PivotTable view 
* Cube Hierarchy Level to enable the PivotTable to view to drilldown through hierarchies of elements 

For  *Portfolio* Cube dimension with three levels in the hierarchy, the cube will be displayed in a Pivot -Table as {Portfolio 1, Portfolio 2, Portfolio 3}, and support drilldown from the highest level

```
@CubeDimension(Id), CubeHierarchy(Parent, Tier), Versioned
entity Cube.Portfolio 
	= Node (SKey = SKey, Name = Id, TypeName = "Portfolio"),
	  Cube.Edges (From = this, To = Parent, FromTypeName = "Portfolio-Parent", ToTypeName = "Portfolio-Child", Name = Id)
(Id : String) 
{ Parent : Cube.Portfolio, Tier : Int32 } 
[Children : Cube.Portfolio (Parent = this)];
```
## Hiperspace
`CubeDimension` has been updated to include a reference to the name that should be used when the Cube is viewed in a Piviot-table view.
`CubeHierarchy` has been updated to include a level indicator to allow Pivot-table views to navigate through hierarchy of elements 


## HiLang
###empty view enhancement
The view `Cube.Edge_` and `Cube.Edges` could be used as helpers to provide additional ways to project *elements* as graph views, but if they are not referenced elsewhere in the model, they will be pruned and not have any code generation.

```
"An additional edge helper for Cube.Edges"
view Cube.Edge_ : Edge = Edge();

"Bidirectional Edge, implemented with two Cube.Edges"
view Cube.Edges
    = Edge  (From = From, To = To, Name = Name, TypeName = FromTypeName),
      Cube.Edge_ (From = To, To = From, Name = Name, TypeName = ToTypeName)
(
    From            : Node      #7,
    To              : Node      #8,
    FromTypeName    : String    #9,
    ToTypeName      : String    #10
)
{
    Name        : String    #6,
};
```
This presents a problem for the generation of the `Edge` subspace, since it expects to add a base reference to the pruned view.  A fix has been added to the HiLang compiler to remove the dependency.  The compiler pipeline has been changed to continue process *transformations* to prevent spurious errors being created from *validation* that depends on prior *transformations* .
