# Overview
## Cube Enhancements
A minor enhancement has been made to fully qualify references to **Hiperspace.Functions**. This prevents naming conflicts when a domain also uses **Functions**.

When one of a Cube’s **Dimensions** is `Node`, the `Node` view is added to the Cube along with `Edge` definitions that represent navigation between the **Dimension** and the Cube. In this release, the naming of these edges has been updated to ensure consistent navigation through a HiperGraph, using a common TypeName convention:

* TypeName `Cube:Drilldown` for navigation from a  *Dimension* to the *Cube*.
* TypeName `Cube:Dimension` for navigation from the *Cube* to a *Dimension*.

### Example
In the [Cube Example](https://github.com/channell/Hiperspace/blob/master/examples/Cube/Cube.hilang) ***Customer Sector*** and ***Product*** are *Dimensions* that can also be viewed as `Nodes`. The ***Contract Cube*** therefore has `Node` and `Edges` added as a views because.

 * ***Contact*** (*Cube*) has one ***Account*** and ***Account*** has one ***Customer*** and ***Customer*** has one ***Sector*** (*Dimension*), it is inferred that  ***Sector*** is a *Dimension* of *Cube* ***Contact***.
 *  ***Contact*** (*Cube*) has one ***Instrument*** and ***Instrument*** has one ***Product***, it is inferred that ***Product*** is a *Dimension* of *Cube* ***Contract***.

When viewed through a **HiperGraph** the *Cube* becomes a `Node` that links ***Sector*** *node* to ***Product*** *Node*
 
If you *drilldown* from ***Product*** to ***Contact_Cube*** and *drilldown* to ***Sector***, the shortest *HiperEdge* from ***Product*** to ***Sector*** is through the ***Contract_Cube*** slice that summarizes the connection between the two `Nodes`.  We call this combination of *HiperGraph* and *Cube* "*HiperCube*", and is useful for **AI** prompts like *"which sector uses most widgets?"*
