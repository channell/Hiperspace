## Overview

Partition elimination is an advanced feature in SQL relational databases, that skip access to a partition view when the optimizer can determine that it will not return any values.  This release adds the feature to Hiperspace views to skip `SetSpace` access that is not needed, *most commonly for Graph queries*

### SQL Views
```
/* for the view */
CREATE VIEW costs AS
SELECT cost, 'Sales' as area FROM sales_costs UNION
SELECT cost, 'Operations' as area FROM ops_costs UNION
SELECT cost, 'Assets' as area FROM asset_costs ;

/* queried as */
SELECT cost FROM costs WHERE area = 'Sales';

/* will skip the query ops_costs and asset_costs since it will return no rows */
```

### Hiperspace Views
Hiperspace views provide the same function, but rather than define a view separately, the view definition is part `element` definition, with the view  being created as a union of all the `elements` { `entity`, `segment`, `aspect`, `view` } that provide the `view`.

```
segment Togaf.Has.Requirement : Togaf.Base 
    = Node        ( SKey = SKey, Name = Name, TypeName = "AF-Requirement"),
      Edges       (From = owner, To = this, Name = Name, FromTypeName = "AF-Has-Requirement", ToTypeName = "AF-Requirement-For") ;
```
defines a `segment` named `Togaf.Has.Requirement` *that can be viewed* as a `Node` with the `TypeName` "AF-Requirement".  Within the [TOGAF](https://github.com/channell/Hiperspace/blob/master/examples/TOGAF/TOGAF.hilang) sample there are 
**201**  elements that *can be viewed* as a `Node`, all of which are included in the `SubSpace` view `Nodes`.  

Prior to this release a LINQ query `from node in Nodes where node.TypeName  == "AF-Requirement";` would scan all **201** `SetSpace` before filtering to include only *requirements*, but will now skip the scan of the other **200** types.  This is especially useful for graph data-explorer browsers that will typically search for a single source node type

This is implemented with the `SetSpace<>` function `public virtual bool IsSkippable(object template) => false;` that is overridden in **HiLang** generated code, and used by all `View` Sets

## RefSet<>
The `RefSet<>` collection of references to segments or other entities (via index) has been updated to include `AddAsync`  to simplify the addition of a segment reference when used from a web-assembly client.
