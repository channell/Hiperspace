# Overview
This release is a minor enhancement to Hiperspace to support the generation of streaming cube aggregation processed by `Hiperspace.DB` for real-time analytics.  Any Hiperspace that has `CubeDimension` and `CubeFact` with `CubeMeasure` are calculated in near real-time when hosted by `Hiperspace.DB`.  Stream aggregation is processed by compiled code, using the compiled access-methods of `HiperSpace` with various frequencies.

| Type |│| When |│| Trigger  |│|Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Full  |│| Often Daily  |│| Scheduled  |│| reaggregates the base level of Cube fact |
| Delta  |│| Continuous  |│| Whenever a fact changes  |│| aggregates the facts and summaries affected by the change to the fact, *but no others* |
| Dependency  |│| Continuous  |│| Whenever a `@DeltaIndex` element references by a fact changes  |│| aggregates the facts and summaries affected by the change to a fact dependency, *but no others*  |
| Related  |│| Frequently  |│|  Whenever a `@DeltaIndex` element related is some way to fact changes |│| aggregates the facts and summaries affected by the change, *but no others*  |
| Dimension |│| Frequently |│| Change to a dimension with a  `@DeltaIndex` changes  |│| Clears any summaries that might now be invalid due to restructure |
| |│| as needed |│| read |│| Any summaries that are not currently stored are recalculated from base facts |


-----

Hiper cubes are also graphs:
* Every `CubeDimension` that provides a `Node` view, also has a *Cube* `Edge` to each of the Cubes created for each `CubeFact`
* Every **Cube** has a *Dimension* `Edge` to each  `CubeDimension` that describes a `CubeFact`
* Every **Cube** has a *Drilldown* `Edge`s for each *dimension* of the **Cube**, that either adds a *dimension* to the summary or drills down through the *dimension* hierarchy

The change also includes updates to referenced assemblies
