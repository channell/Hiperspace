## Overview

This version updates to .NET 10 and modernizes the code to use `name != null` and `ReferenceEquals(name, null)` 
to `name is not null`.

The `is null` and `is not null` patterns are **billed** as
> provide a clearer and more concise way to check for null values in C#. This change enhances readability and aligns with current C# best practices.

but the main advantage is that:
* You don't need to include `ReferenceEquals` in any `operator ==` overload.
* `name is not null` is the same for reference (*class*) and value (*struct*) objects instead of `ReferenceEquals(name, null)` for classes and `!name.HasValue` for nullable values.
