## Overview

**Hiperspace** uses the [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) wire format to serialize **elements** in the domain **SubSpace**
for persistence as a *key/value* in the store (primarily [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/)), with *minimal* transformation and no padding.

The schema can evolve without the need to alter history, using two rules:
* #id numeric aliases for {entities, segments, aspects, keys, values, indexes} are never reused
* The datatype of {keys, values} is never changed (*other than by renaming items*)

### MetaModel

The `MetaModel` contains a list of all the *Element* types stored within a Hiperspace and the data types of each *key*
and *value*. The `MetaModel` is eternal—additional *Element* types are added as the schema changes, but never removed, to ensure that
older builds can still read the data that they understand.

When a **Hiperspace** is opened, the domain `MetaModel` is compared with the `MetaModel` stored in the **Hiperspace** to ensure the
above rules have not been compromised. All reads and writes after opening use the wire format directly, without transformation, from store
through to the client application (including browser web-assembly).

### MetaMap

To support range access, the bytes in the wire format for keys are reordered to place message lengths at the end of the `byte[]`
for each key. This is especially important for *segments* (where the parent knows only the `owner` part of the key) and *indexes*.

The `MetaMap` is an ordered array of #id and mapping of *key/value* #id to the element #id of references. The `MetaMap` is coded
in the domain assembly. This release adds the capability to remove key references without the need to create a new element type, by
regenerating the `MetaMap` from the `MetaModel` stored in **Hiperspace**.

### Change

This release changes the method signatures of {`KeyPath`, `IndexPath`} to support a MetaMap built at load time, and
adds additional abstract methods to `Hiperspace` to load and merge the `MetaModel`.

The `MetaModelException` exception type has been added to provide detailed diagnostics if the `MetaModel` is not compatible.
